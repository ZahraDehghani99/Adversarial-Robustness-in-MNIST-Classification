# Adversarial-Robustness-in-MNIST-Classification

This project explores adversarial robustness in the MNIST digit classification task. It involves training a CNN-based classifier on the MNIST dataset and implementing various adversarial attack techniques, such as FGSM, to assess model vulnerability. The project also includes developing and applying defense mechanisms to enhance the modelâ€™s resilience against these attacks.
